for now, let's review how to make a structure.

we'll want a structure type that holds both the specifier adn the text that replaces it

- it may have to have a slot for each valid data type, and then only fill the relevant ones.

- have a slot to hold it's output string as well

we'll use it by declaring it early.

- then malloc the space needed once we've counted the number of specifiers


# Structure created! Good job~~~â™ª

We can work on the sorting function now.

we'll need a pointable variable that keeps out position, or we'll need to be able to *format++ to change positions

let's start with 

			while (*format)
				if (*format is a normal character, putchar)


---

# basic text is handled. excellent work.

now we want to send the "else" to a function that handles special characters

we'll send *format (the current character,) *(format + 1) (the next character, address or pointer to current count of printed characters (so it can add) and argList (current argument. automatically incriments)

- it needs both current and next char so it can differentiate between / and %

- pointer is so we can edit the same incriment variable across the two functions
